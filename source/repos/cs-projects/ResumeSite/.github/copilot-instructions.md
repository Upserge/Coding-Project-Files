# Copilot Instructions

## Project Guidelines
- Do NOT deploy to the Jason.io GitHub Pages repo unless the user specifically asks. Only build locally so they can review changes first before pushing to production.
- After pushing to the Jason.io repo, always navigate the terminal back to the project directory: C:\Users\upser\OneDrive\Desktop\Coding-Project-Files\source\repos\cs-projects\ResumeSite
